# Steam Collection Creator

This little app lets you create collections of items in your description, [like here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=715656653)

To make it work, simply download the package for your system (only Linux and Windows supported), and upack it in your computer. You mst first complete the file 'data.json' with the correct information about your items. The necessary information are the workshop link, the button link (when you click on that button, it will get you to the chosen item page), and the active button link (this button will not be clickable when on the item's page)

The file 'data.json' has default values that allowed me to create the collection above.
